# trackReads
Track reads Between alignment files. Intended for use for the RNASeq protocols comparisson

For the time being, the two alignment files plus a special annotation file are hardcoded inside the .sh file. 

For future development:
1. Write a function to process any GTF file and not have to do it 
2. Put all files in a seperate place inthe shell script
